1.	Identify the class of each variable/column
2.	Create a new categorical variable for “Married”, labelled as 1= “Married”, 0 = “Not married”
3.	Obtain the frequency table of “SmokingHx”, “Sex”
4.	Calculate the mean and standard deviation for all continuous variables, including “Age”, “BMI”
5.	Group subjects into five age groups:
		Age 25-35, 35-45, 45-55, 55-65, 65+
6.	What is the frequency of current smokers in each age group and each gender group?
7.	What are the mean and standard deviation of “Age” and “BMI” in different smoking groups (i.e., never, former, current)? Save the results as table in CSV or TXT file. 
8.	Test the mean difference between these smoking groups:
		a.	Never vs. former
		b.	Former vs. current
		c.	Never vs. current
		d.	Never vs. former and current
