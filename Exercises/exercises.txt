Use "hdp" data:

1.	Combine data files “hdp1” and “hdp2” based on subjects’ IDs
	(Hints, you can use separate files (“hdp1” and “hdp2”) in CSV or TXT formats or use the Excel file contains both in two separate spreadsheets.)
2.	Identify the class of each variable/column
3.	Create a new categorical variable for “Married”, labelled as 1= “Married”, 0 = “Not married”
4.	Obtain the frequency table of “SmokingHx”, “Sex”
5.	Calculate the mean and standard deviation for all continuous variables, including “Age”, “BMI”
6.	Group subjects into five age groups:
		Age 25-35, 35-45, 45-55, 55-65, 65+
7.	What is the frequency of current smokers in each age group and each gender group?
8.	What are the mean and standard deviation of “Age” and “BMI” in different smoking groups (i.e., never, former, current)? Save the results as table in CSV or TXT file. 
9.	Test the mean difference between these smoking groups:
		a.	Never vs. former
		b.	Former vs. current
		c.	Never vs. current
		d.	Never vs. former and current


Use "external" data:

10. Clean data "external" (e.g., remove duplicates, remove typos with excess letters for numeric variables)
11. Convert data "external" from long to wide format for variable "EXTERNAL" according to different "TIME" points
12. Divide the values for "EXTERNAL" by 10 and convert the wide data to long format
